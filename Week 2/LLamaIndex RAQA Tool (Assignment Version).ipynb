LlamaIndex can largely be thought of as an extension to LangChain, in some ways - but they moved some of the language around. Let's spend a few moments disambiguating the language.\n","\n","- `QueryEngine` -> `RetrievalQA`:\n","  -  `QueryEngine` is just LlamaIndex's way of indicating something is an LLM \"chain\" on top of a retrieval system\n","- `OpenAIAgent` vs. `ZeroShotAgent`:\n","  - The two agents have the same fundamental pattern: Decide which of a list of tools to use to answer a user's query.\n","  - `OpenAIAgent` (LlamaIndex's primary agent) does not need to rely on an agent excecutor due to the fact that it is leveraging OpenAI's [functional api](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) which allows the agent to interface \"directly\" with the tools instead of operating through an intermediary application process.\n","\n","There is, however, a much large terminological difference when it comes to discussing data.\n","\n","##### Nodes vs. Documents\n","\n","As you're aware of from the previous weeks assignments, there's an idea of `documents` in NLP which refers to text objects that exist within a corpus of documents.\n","\n","LlamaIndex takes this a step further and reclassifies `documents` as `nodes`. Confusingly, it refers to the `Source Document` as simply `Documents`.\n","\n","The `Document` -> `node` structure is, almost exactly, equivalent to the `Source Document` -> `Document` structure found in LangChain - but the new terminology comes with some clarity about different structure-indices.\n","\n","We won't be leveraging those structured indicies today, but we will be leveraging a \"benefit\" of the `node` structure that exists as a default in LlamaIndex, which is the ability to quickly filter nodes based on their metadata.\n","\n","![image](https://i.imgur.com/B1QDjs5.png)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":50,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4121,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692899817490,"user":{"displayName":"Raul Padua","userId":"04915720199064680008"},"user_tz":180},"id":"ZLRxPq9R1eT2","outputId":"8f41620e-954b-408f-fa83-b5d7a7030078"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":51,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":392,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692899819815,"user":{"displayName":"Raul Padua","userId":"04915720199064680008"},"user_tz":180},"id":"qagn0YlI1x5d","outputId":"56b996ed-076e-4cfc-d37f-4c896c2cc246"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/LLMOps-AIMakerpace/LLM-Ops-Cohort-1-main/Week 2\n"]}],"source":["%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/LLMOps-AIMakerpace/LLM-Ops-Cohort-1-main/Week 2"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AxUrK--24Mjc"},"source":["### BOILERPLATE\n","\n","This is only relevant when running the code in a Jupyter Notebook."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":618,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692899955553,"user":{"displayName":"Raul Padua","userId":"04915720199064680008"},"user_tz":180},"id":"MMFIx0XA4Mjc"},"outputs":[],"source":["import nest_asyncio\n","\n","nest_asyncio.apply()\n","\n","import logging\n","import sys\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)\n","logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eA2NizwH4Mjd"},"source":["### Primary Dependencies and Context Setting"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q6lSJzwP4Mjd"},"source":["#### Dependencies and OpenAI API key setting\n","\n","First of all, we'll need our primary libraries - and to set up our OpenAI API key."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17381,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692899973236,"user":{"displayName":"Raul Padua","userId":"04915720199064680008"},"user_tz":180},"id":"tln2U8ai4Mjd"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install -U -q openai==0.27.8 llama-index==0.8.6 nltk==3.8.1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2778,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692899976004,"user":{"displayName":"Raul Padua","userId":"04915720199064680008"},"user_tz":180},"id":"nUPFhLMa4Mje","outputId":"2a1c1d29-c0ff-48bb-87f9-1f2cda196e1d"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["OpenAI API Key: ··········\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","import getpass\n","\n","os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"OpenAI API Key: \")\n","\n","import openai\n","openai.api_key = os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XHdmERUh4Mje"},"source":["#### Context Setting\n","\n","Now, LlamaIndex has the ability to set `ServiceContext`.
