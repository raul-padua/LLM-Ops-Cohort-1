The incident was also noteworthy because it occurred at a critical moment in the match, with England needing only twenty-eight runs to win."}]}

Once it is picked, it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years. Then one night, it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. The purpose of this cycle is not clearly understood.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The life cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit is intriguing. After being harvested, it requires a dim, dust-filled drawer for undisturbed maturation over several years. Unexpectedly, it hatches one night, shedding its outer layer which disintegrates into dust, and transforms into a small, unrecognizable metal piece with flanges on both ends and a peculiar ridge and hole suitable for a screw. This object, when discovered, is typically discarded. The reason behind this cycle remains a mystery."}]}
